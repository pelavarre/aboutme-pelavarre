# aboutme-pelavarre

i put my icon in words at
https://github.com/pelavarre/aboutme-pelavarre/blob/master/icon-pelavarre.md

there's not much of anything else in this Repo

lately at GitHub i'm working only with
ByoBash-Demo https://github.com/pelavarre/byobash-demo

less top-level repos is better, so I bury my most abandoned repos inside AboutMe-PELaVarre, and i leave many repos unpinned
